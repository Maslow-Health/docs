## Taking a survey

When you receive a survey link from your provider:

1. **Click the link** in your email to open the survey
2. **Read each question carefully** and select the response that best describes your experience
3. **Answer honestly** — there are no right or wrong answers. Your responses help your provider give you the best care
4. **Submit** when you're finished — you'll see a confirmation screen

### Saving progress

{/* TODO: Can patients save and return later? Or must they complete in one sitting? */}

If you need to take a break, your progress may be saved automatically. You can return to the survey using the same email link.

### Changing answers

{/* TODO: Can patients change answers before submitting? After submitting? */}

You can go back and change your answers before submitting. Once submitted, responses cannot be modified — contact your provider if you need to make corrections.

## Survey types

Your provider may send you different types of surveys:

{/* TODO: Describe common survey types in patient-friendly language */}

- **Mood and wellbeing** — questions about how you've been feeling recently
- **Anxiety and stress** — questions about worry, tension, and nervousness
- **Substance use** — questions about alcohol or substance use patterns
- **Custom assessments** — questions specific to your care plan

## After you submit

Your responses are securely transmitted to your provider. They may use the results during your next appointment or follow up with you directly if needed.
