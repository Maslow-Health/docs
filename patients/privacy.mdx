## Your data is protected

MASLOW takes the privacy of your health information seriously. Here's what you should know about how your data is handled.

### Who can see your responses

{/* TODO: Confirm exact visibility rules — can all providers at the clinic see responses, or only assigned provider? */}

- **Your provider** — the clinician who assigned your survey can view your responses and AI-generated reports
- **Clinic administrators** — may have access for operational purposes
- **You** — you can request a copy of your data at any time
- **No one else** — your responses are not shared with insurance companies, employers, or other third parties without your consent

### How AI is used

{/* TODO: Detail AI opt-out process if available */}

MASLOW uses AI to help your provider understand your survey responses by summarizing themes and identifying patterns. The AI does not make clinical decisions — your provider reviews all AI-generated insights.

**Important:** AI analysis is used to support your provider's clinical work. If you have concerns about AI processing of your responses, discuss this with your provider.

### Data encryption

All data is encrypted both in transit (while being sent) and at rest (while stored). This means your information is protected from unauthorized access at every stage.

## Your rights

{/* TODO: Confirm specific rights — vary by state/regulation */}

- **Access** — request a copy of your health data
- **Correction** — request corrections to inaccurate information
- **Deletion** — request deletion of your data (subject to legal retention requirements)

To exercise any of these rights, contact your healthcare provider's office.
