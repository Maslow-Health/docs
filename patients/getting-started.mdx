## Accessing MASLOW

You don't need to download an app or create a password. When your provider sends you a survey, you'll receive an email with a secure link.

### How it works

1. **Check your email** — look for a message from MASLOW Health
2. **Click the link** — this opens your survey directly in your browser
3. **Complete the survey** — answer the questions at your own pace
4. **Submit** — your responses are securely sent to your provider

### No password required

MASLOW uses secure magic links instead of passwords. Each time you need to access the platform, you'll receive a new link via email. This keeps your account secure without requiring you to remember another password.

## What to expect

Your provider may send you surveys periodically to track your progress. Each survey takes a few minutes to complete and helps your provider understand how you're doing.

## Need help?

If you have trouble accessing a survey or have questions about your responses, contact your healthcare provider's office directly.
