## Assigning a survey

{/* TODO: Add screenshots of the assignment flow */}

1. From the provider dashboard, click **Assign survey**
2. Select a patient (or create a new patient profile)
3. Choose a survey from your available templates or custom surveys
4. Set an optional due date
5. Click **Send** — the patient receives a magic link via email

### Magic links

{/* TODO: Confirm magic link behavior — expiration, reuse, security */}

Patients access surveys through magic links sent to their email. No password or app download is required. Each link is unique and single-use for security.

## Tracking assignments

### Assignment status

Track where each assignment stands:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Sent** | Survey delivered, not yet started |
| **In progress** | Patient has opened the survey |
| **Completed** | Patient submitted responses |
| **Expired** | Past due date, not completed |

{/* TODO: Can providers resend expired assignments? Send reminders? */}

### Reminders

{/* TODO: Detail reminder functionality — automatic vs. manual, frequency */}

Patients who haven't completed their survey can be sent reminders from the assignment detail view.

## Bulk assignments

{/* TODO: Can providers assign the same survey to multiple patients at once? */}

For recurring assessments, you can assign the same survey to multiple patients simultaneously from the **Surveys** page.
