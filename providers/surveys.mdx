## Survey creation

{/* TODO: Add screenshots of the survey creation flow */}

### From a template

Start with a validated clinical instrument:

1. Navigate to **Surveys** → **Create survey**
2. Browse the template library (PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCL-5, etc.)
3. Select a template — questions and scoring are pre-configured
4. Optionally customize the introduction text or add supplementary questions
5. Save and [assign to patients](/providers/assignments)

### Custom surveys

Build a survey from scratch:

{/* TODO: Detail question types available — multiple choice, Likert scale, free text, etc. */}

1. Navigate to **Surveys** → **Create survey** → **Custom**
2. Add questions using the survey builder
3. Configure response types and optional scoring
4. Preview the patient experience
5. Save the survey

### AI-assisted creation

{/* TODO: Detail the AI survey creation feature — how does it work, what inputs does it take */}

MASLOW can help you generate survey questions based on clinical goals. Describe what you're trying to measure, and the AI suggests relevant questions that you can review, edit, and approve.

## Managing your surveys

### Editing surveys

{/* TODO: Can surveys be edited after assignment? What happens to in-progress responses? */}

Surveys can be edited before they're assigned. Once a survey has active assignments, changes create a new version.

### Survey versions

{/* TODO: How does versioning work? Can providers see which version a patient completed? */}

MASLOW tracks survey versions so you can compare results across different iterations of the same survey.
