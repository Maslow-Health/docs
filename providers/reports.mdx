## AI clinical reports

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of a sample report (redacted) */}

When a patient completes a survey, MASLOW generates an AI-powered clinical report that summarizes responses, identifies key themes, and highlights areas of concern.

### What's in a report

{/* TODO: Confirm report sections — do they vary by survey type? */}

A typical report includes:

- **Summary** — high-level overview of patient responses
- **Score interpretation** — for validated instruments (PHQ-9, GAD-7, etc.), scores mapped to clinical severity levels
- **Key themes** — AI-identified patterns and topics from free-text responses
- **Risk indicators** — flagged responses that may require immediate attention
- **Longitudinal trends** — comparison with previous survey results (when available)

### Understanding AI-generated content

{/* TODO: Add guidance on AI limitations, clinical judgment disclaimer */}

AI reports are designed to support — not replace — clinical judgment. All AI-generated insights should be reviewed by a qualified provider before informing treatment decisions.

## Working with reports

### Exporting reports

{/* TODO: What export formats are available? PDF, EHR integration? */}

Reports can be exported for inclusion in patient records or shared with other members of the care team.

### EHR integration

{/* TODO: Detail EHR integration options — which EHRs, how does the data flow */}

MASLOW supports integration with common EHR systems. Contact your administrator for details on your clinic's integration setup.
