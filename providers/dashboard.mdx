## Dashboard overview

{/* TODO: Add screenshot of the provider dashboard */}

The provider dashboard is your home base in MASLOW. It gives you an at-a-glance view of:

- **Pending surveys** — assignments sent but not yet completed
- **Recent completions** — surveys completed and ready for review
- **AI reports** — generated reports awaiting your review
- **Patient list** — your active patients and their survey history

## Key sections

### Patient list

{/* TODO: Detail patient list features — search, filters, status indicators */}

View all patients assigned to you, their survey completion status, and links to their reports.

### Notifications

{/* TODO: What notifications appear in the dashboard vs. email */}

The dashboard shows real-time notifications when patients complete surveys and when AI reports are ready for review.

## Quick actions

From the dashboard, you can:

- [Create a new survey](/providers/surveys)
- [Assign a survey to a patient](/providers/assignments)
- [Review completed reports](/providers/reports)
