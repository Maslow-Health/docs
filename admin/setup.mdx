## Initial configuration

{/* TODO: Add specific onboarding steps — what happens after contract signing, who gets the first invite, etc. */}

When your clinic signs up for MASLOW, you'll receive an admin invitation email. Click the link to create your administrator account and begin setup.

### Clinic profile

After signing in, configure your clinic details:

- **Clinic name** — displayed to patients in surveys and communications
- **Contact information** — used for support and notifications
- **Timezone** — determines scheduling and report timestamps

{/* TODO: Add screenshots of the clinic settings page */}

### Notification preferences

Configure how your clinic receives notifications about survey completions, new patient activity, and system alerts.

{/* TODO: Detail notification channels — email, in-app, etc. */}

## What's next

Once your clinic is configured:

1. [Invite providers and staff](/admin/users)
2. [Set up survey templates](/admin/surveys)
3. Providers can begin [assigning surveys to patients](/providers/assignments)
