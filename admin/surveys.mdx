## Survey templates

{/* TODO: Clarify distinction between admin survey management and provider survey creation */}

Admins can manage the survey templates available to providers across the clinic. This includes enabling validated instruments from the template library and configuring clinic-wide survey settings.

### Template library

MASLOW includes validated clinical instruments:

{/* TODO: Confirm which instruments are available */}

- **PHQ-9** — Patient Health Questionnaire (depression screening)
- **GAD-7** — Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale
- **PCL-5** — PTSD Checklist
- **AUDIT** — Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
- Additional validated instruments as configured for your clinic

### Custom surveys

{/* TODO: Detail the custom survey builder — question types, branching logic, AI assistance */}

Providers can also create custom surveys with AI assistance. See [Creating surveys](/providers/surveys) for details.

## Survey settings

### Scoring and thresholds

{/* TODO: Can admins configure scoring thresholds for alerts? */}

Configure scoring thresholds to flag results that need immediate clinical attention.

### Data retention

{/* TODO: What are the default retention policies? Can admins configure them? */}

Survey responses are retained according to your clinic's data retention policy. See [Data handling](/security/data) for details.
