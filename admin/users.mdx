## User roles

MASLOW uses three roles to control access:

| Role | Access |
|------|--------|
| **Admin** | Full clinic configuration, user management, all surveys and reports |
| **Provider** | Create surveys, assign to patients, view AI reports for their patients |
| **Patient** | Complete assigned surveys, view their own data |

For details on what each role can access, see [Roles & permissions](/security/roles).

## Inviting users

### Invite a provider

{/* TODO: Add specific UI steps — where is the invite button, what fields are required */}

1. Go to **Users** in the admin dashboard
2. Click **Invite user**
3. Enter the provider's email address and select the **Provider** role
4. The provider receives an email with a link to create their account

### Patient accounts

{/* TODO: Clarify — are patients created by providers during assignment, or invited separately? */}

Patient accounts are typically created when a provider first assigns a survey. The patient receives a magic link via email — no password setup required.

## Managing existing users

### Deactivating accounts

{/* TODO: Add deactivation flow — what happens to their data, surveys in progress, etc. */}

Admins can deactivate user accounts from the **Users** page. Deactivated users lose access but their historical data is preserved for clinical records.

### Editing roles

{/* TODO: Can roles be changed after creation? Any restrictions? */}

Contact your MASLOW account representative to modify user roles after account creation.
