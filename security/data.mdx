## Encryption

### In transit

All data transmitted between clients and MASLOW servers is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher. This includes:

- Patient survey submissions
- Provider dashboard access
- API communications
- Email notifications (via TLS-enabled email providers)

### At rest

{/* TODO: Confirm specific encryption details — KMS key management, database encryption */}

All stored data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption. This covers:

- Database records (survey responses, patient profiles, reports)
- File storage (exported reports, attachments)
- Backups and archives

## Data storage

{/* TODO: Confirm AWS region, data residency details */}

- **Location** — data stored in AWS US regions
- **Database** — managed database services with automated backups
- **Isolation** — tenant data is logically isolated

## Data retention

{/* TODO: Confirm retention policies — how long is data kept, can clinics configure this */}

MASLOW retains clinical data in accordance with applicable healthcare record retention requirements. Default retention periods:

| Data type | Retention period |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Survey responses | Per clinic policy (minimum as required by state law) |
| AI reports | Same as survey responses |
| User accounts | Until deactivated + retention period |
| Audit logs | Minimum 6 years |

{/* TODO: Confirm these retention periods */}

## Audit logging

All access to patient data is logged, including:

- Who accessed the data
- When the access occurred
- What action was performed (view, export, etc.)

{/* TODO: Can admins view audit logs? How? */}

Audit logs are retained for a minimum of 6 years in compliance with HIPAA requirements.

## Data deletion

{/* TODO: Detail deletion process — how to request, timeline, what gets permanently removed */}

Patients can request deletion of their data by contacting their healthcare provider. Deletion requests are processed in accordance with applicable healthcare record retention laws.
