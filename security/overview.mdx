## Built for healthcare

MASLOW is designed from the ground up to handle sensitive health information securely. This page summarizes our approach to security across the platform.

### Infrastructure

{/* TODO: Confirm infrastructure details — AWS region, SOC 2 status, etc. */}

- **Cloud hosting** — hosted on AWS with infrastructure designed for healthcare workloads
- **Encryption in transit** — all data transmitted over TLS 1.2+
- **Encryption at rest** — all stored data encrypted using AES-256
- **Network isolation** — backend services run in private subnets with no direct internet access

### Authentication

{/* TODO: Confirm auth details — Cognito, MFA options */}

- **Provider/admin authentication** — secure login with email and password via AWS Cognito
- **Patient access** — magic link authentication (no passwords to steal or phish)
- **Session management** — automatic session expiration and secure token handling

### Access control

- **Role-based access** — three roles (admin, provider, patient) with the principle of least privilege
- **Data isolation** — patients can only see their own data; providers see only their assigned patients

See [Roles & permissions](/security/roles) for the full access control breakdown.
