## Role overview

MASLOW uses role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only access what they need. There are three roles:

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Clinic administrator — manages users, settings, and survey templates |
| **Provider** | Clinician — creates surveys, assigns to patients, reviews AI reports |
| **Patient** | End user — completes assigned surveys |

## Permission matrix

{/* TODO: Verify these permissions against actual RBAC implementation */}

| Action | Admin | Provider | Patient |
|--------|:-----:|:--------:|:-------:|
| Configure clinic settings | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Invite/manage users | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage survey templates | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create custom surveys | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Assign surveys to patients | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View AI reports | ✅ | ✅ (own patients) | ❌ |
| Complete surveys | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| View own survey responses | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| View audit logs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Role assignment

{/* TODO: How are roles assigned — during invitation? Can they be changed? */}

Roles are assigned when a user is invited to MASLOW. Admin users control role assignments for their clinic.

### Provider scope

{/* TODO: Confirm provider data isolation — can providers see all patients or only assigned? */}

Providers can only view data for patients assigned to them. They cannot access other providers' patients or clinic-wide analytics (unless also granted admin access).

### Patient scope

Patients can only access their own surveys and responses. They cannot see other patients' data or any provider/admin interfaces.

## Multi-clinic access

{/* TODO: Can users belong to multiple clinics? How does that work? */}

Users are scoped to a single clinic. If a provider works at multiple clinics using MASLOW, they need separate accounts for each.
