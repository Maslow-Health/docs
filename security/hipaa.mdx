## HIPAA overview

{/* TODO: Confirm BAA status, covered entity vs. business associate relationship */}

MASLOW operates as a business associate under HIPAA. We execute Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) with all covered entity clients and maintain safeguards required under the HIPAA Security Rule.

## Technical safeguards

| Safeguard | Implementation |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Access control** | Role-based access, unique user IDs, automatic session timeout |
| **Audit controls** | All access to PHI is logged with timestamps and user identity |
| **Integrity controls** | Data validation, checksums, and version tracking |
| **Transmission security** | TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit |

{/* TODO: Confirm specific implementations and add detail */}

## Administrative safeguards

{/* TODO: Detail administrative safeguards — training, policies, incident response */}

- **Workforce training** — all MASLOW team members receive HIPAA training
- **Access management** — access to production systems restricted to authorized personnel
- **Incident response** — documented procedures for identifying and responding to security incidents
- **Risk assessments** — regular security risk assessments conducted

## Physical safeguards

{/* TODO: Confirm physical safeguards — AWS handles most of this */}

MASLOW infrastructure runs on AWS, which maintains physical security controls including:

- Data center access controls
- Environmental protections
- Equipment disposal procedures

## Breach notification

{/* TODO: Detail breach notification process and timeline */}

In the event of a breach involving PHI, MASLOW follows HIPAA breach notification requirements, including timely notification to affected covered entities.
