## Overview

This guide walks you through the key steps to start using MASLOW at your clinic, from initial setup to your first patient survey.

### 1. Clinic setup (admins)

Your clinic administrator will handle the initial configuration:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="building" title="Configure your clinic">
    {/* TODO: Add specific steps for clinic configuration — name, address, settings */}
    Your MASLOW account comes pre-configured with your clinic details. Sign in with the credentials provided during onboarding to review and update your clinic settings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="users" title="Invite your team">
    {/* TODO: Add steps for inviting providers and staff */}
    Add providers and staff from the **Users** section in the admin dashboard. Each user receives an email invitation to create their account.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 2. Create surveys (providers)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="clipboard-list" title="Set up your first survey">
    {/* TODO: Add details on survey creation — template library, custom questions, AI-assisted */}
    Navigate to **Surveys** in the provider dashboard. You can start from a validated template (PHQ-9, GAD-7, etc.) or create a custom survey with AI assistance.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="paper-plane" title="Assign to patients">
    {/* TODO: Add assignment flow details */}
    Select a patient, choose a survey, and send the assignment. Patients receive a magic link via email to complete the survey — no app download or password required.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Review results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="brain" title="View AI-powered reports">
    {/* TODO: Add details on report types and how to interpret them */}
    Once a patient completes a survey, MASLOW generates a clinical report with AI-powered insights. Reports are available in the provider dashboard and can be integrated into your EHR.
